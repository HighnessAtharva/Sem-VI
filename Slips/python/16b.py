# Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The subclass has an init function which takes an argument Length. Both classes should have methods to calculate area and perimeter of a given shape.

class Shape:
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        print(f"Area of {type(self).__name__}: {self.length ** 2}")

    def perimeter(self):
        print(f"Perimeter of {type(self).__name__}: {self.length * 4}")


class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__(length)

    def area(self):
        super().area()

    def perimeter(self):
        super().perimeter()


square = Square(5)
square.area()
square.perimeter()
