# Write a Python program that counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string.

# Approach 1: Counter method (Would recommend)
from collections import Counter
my_string = 'thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog'
print(Counter(my_string))

# Approach 2: Dictionary Comprehension (for dummies)
my_string = 'thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog'
print({i: my_string.count(i) for i in my_string})
