# Write a file handling program in python, which opens the file â€˜report.txtâ€™ and write data into it. Use the seek() and tell() functions in python while reading the data from the file.

with open(file='12B-file.txt', mode='w') as f:
    f.write('Hello World')
    print("[Hello World written to file]")
    print(f"Cursor Position [f.tell]->{f.tell()}")
    print(f"Cursor Position reset to zero [f.seek]->{f.seek(0)}")

with open(file='12B-file.txt', mode='r') as f:
    print(f"Reading from file [f.read]->{f.read()}")
